For this project, I refactored the website to satisfy accessibility criteria. 

The following configurations were implemented:

In HTML:
    - Added in a title: "Horiseon Social Solution Services"
    - Added alt attributes to image elements. 
    - Changed footer heading to h4 from h2 to identify it easier in CSS.


In CSS: I Reformatted CSS classes to make it more concise and efficient, by combining elements in one class where they had identical attributes. 

    - I restructured element groups in sequential order according to how they are presented in the HTML sheet. For instance, after the hero class, next should be the elements that fall under the content class, followed by the headings and image class for this section. Then the benefits class comes next, followed by the sections, headings and benefit images for this section. Last is the footer. 

    - I grouped the images, headers and structure classes together where they had the same styling attributes. 
    - For instance, I changed the class names of the images under the content class to 'h2,'1 as the same styling attributes were applied to all 3 images. 
    - I did the same for the images under the content class.
